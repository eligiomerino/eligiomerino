### About Me üïπ

I am a full hands-on guy with over 25 years experience in most IT critical fields. I lead by example and manage myself into a forward-thinking model. As a thought Senior Leader, I keep up with emerging technologies and methodologies. I embrace challenges with a flexible mindset. I set objectives by analyzing the current project‚Äôs state. I establish efficient communication bridges. Through coaching and mentoring, I enhance the capabilities of junior staff and teams. I bring multi-discipline teams together to collaborate as a solid single unit. I align incentives to contribute on achieving objectives. I know that the road to success is not straight forward and I strongly believe that everything is possible by focusing on the quality of the process rather than the results, because when a process is well designed it always bring good results.
